This is a tool that lets you have wordle. I'm thinking of making tabs but this is what I currently have. 
Tabs: Ability to switch pages using a UI. Will this take work? Absolutely. Can I do it? Probably not

**What is WordleTricks?**
WordleTricks is a website by me (original by evaan) that tells you the wordle for today and tomorrow!

**What are the extra links?**
The first one can hack your score. **"How?"** A bunch of join blocks **(uses scratch)**. 
The second one can tell you **any** word/**all** the words up to December 31 2022.

**Did you steal this?**
Idfk. I gave credit.. :)
